# DragMapLocationPicker

We all come across applications or ideas where we may want users to pick or select their location from maps. From a UX perspective, it is more convenient to pick a location than to manually enter the fields given.
Also, from the developer's perspective getting user location with pinpoint accuracy helps in getting the job done as required concerning location more precisely.

Well, it's quite easy, you just have to call a few Google Maps APIs, set up location permissions precisely, and create your layout for location picker and thatâ€™s all!!!

Features :
* Runtime Location Permission Dialog (Supported Upto Android 12)
  (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)
* Pick locations using "touch" gestures on the map (Dragging Map, not Marker)
* Customize Address (like Society Name, City, Pin Code, Landmark etc)
* Get Latitude & Longitude
* Smooth Animation around marker while dragging map to find specific point on map
* Lottie Animation (https://airbnb.design/lottie/, https://lottiefiles.com/)

Prerequisites :

* minSdkVersion >= 21
* Google Play Services = 17.0.0 (You can change it's version as per your need)
* AndroidX
